# IoT-Digital-Forensics-Course

I have created a free Internet of Things (IoT) Digital Forensics Course which includes several digital forensic images of IoT devices. 
The goals are to provide an overview and some hands-on analysis of common IoT digital forensics data.

I dedicate this course to all Law Enforcement Personnel everywhere (and their civilian counterparts) â€“ past, present and yet to come.  

I admire, respect and appreciate the dedication of Law Enforcment Personnel and hope that this course can be of value to them.  

I am honored to be a part of the cybersecurity and digital forensic community and this is my humble attempt to also add value to 
that community.

My thanks to the Technical Reviewer of this course - Douglas A. Orr, Ph.D., Asst. Dept. Head,  Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice, 
Univ. Of North Georgia.

Respectfully submitted,
R. Jean Costello
